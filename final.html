			<h1>Note #1</h1>
			<p>Congrats on finding my first note! As I suspected it, your virtual farming skills are as good as in real life.
				<br> <br> I should probably mention this more often but your farming knowledge and skills are one of your most attractive qualities. 
				You are one of the most dedicated and committed workers I have ever met and everytime we go on our farming adventures I admire you a little more. 
				I love saying my girlfriend wants to be a farmer and a shepherd! And I love it even more when you teach me a random fact about plants, sheep or regenerative agriculture.

			<p>Farm related things I am grateful for:</p> 
			<p>1. Thank you for introducing me to Stardew Valley (and I am sorry it took me so long to start playing it. I never should have doubted your taste in videogames)</p>
			<p>2. Thank you for going with me to ask some random shepherds in Los Picos de Europa if they knew about any apprenticeships. You always make me feel braver  </p> 
			<p>3. Thank you for inviting me to Vermont. Being in the Mountain School with you is one of my favorite memories together (I still have dreams about those lunches)</p> 
			<p>4. Thank you for teaching me to see the world around me (especially when it comes to non-human beings) a little different  </p>

			<p>You have said this as a joke, but I do believe having a girlfriend as artsy as you is a privilege. You are literally talented at (almost) all art activites. 
				You knit intricate patterns. You make creative and delicate ceramics. You draw (almost non-racist) portraits of me. You even cook insanely delicious food! 
				Thank you for making my life more colorful, crafty, fun and full of art.

			<h1>Note #8</h1>
			<p>One of the things I admire the most about you is that when you set your mind to something, you just make it happen. One day you decided you wanted to raise sheep, so you worked in Vermont, went to a sheperding school in Spain and learned to shear.
				That's why I actually take you so seriously when you tell me you want to travel the world shearing sheep. I know that if you really want it, there is a 100% chance it will happen. That's just who you are. And the same principle applies to sheep, mutual aid art week, founding a school and making gloves.
